## Redefining Digital Identity

Zyphe is a tech company dedicated to redefining Digital Identity by empowering users to regain control over their personal data. 
We offer a suite of innovative solutions designed to make Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) practical and effective in real-world applications.

The first module focuses on decentralized Identity Verification. 
By leveraging robust cryptography and advanced technologies like Zero-Knowledge Cryptography, we achieve decentralization across two primary dimensions: ownership and geography.

The company is based in Delaware and backed by top-tier international investors and angel supporters at the seed stage.
